# Neuroshack's profile conceptual framework
Details:
This is a practice profile page for Neuroshack.io The framework is meant to be simple
but the code might need more structure. Looking to maybe intergate a .json file for better operability.
Fork it to help better development, any contributions will be greatly appreciated!
